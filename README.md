Professional Portofilo

User Story
As a software developer seeking work, I want a professional portfolio showcasing my work for potential employers to view. 

Acceptance Criteria
When I need to show a potential employer my work, I load my professional portfolio. I am then presented with a webpage showcasing all of my past work. 

When a potential employer clicks on my past work, the links take them to the project.
